## Overview
- This challenge was very straightforward, using simple HTML and CSS to build. Though it was fairly simple, one area I found interesting was the unordered and ordered lists. I have never styled the bullet points and/or numbers for the lists. This did take some research on my part, but I was able to learn something new.
